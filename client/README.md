# Poll App Client Setup Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the client-side (React) application of the Poll App project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git:** If you haven't installed Git, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## 📁 Client

The `client` folder contains all the client-side code for the React application. Here's the updated structure of the `client` folder:

```
client
│
├── public                  # Contains public assets (HTML, images, etc.) served by the React app
├── src                     # Main source code for the React application
│   ├── Assets              # Contains all the assets
|   |   ├── Icons           # Icons
|   |   ├── Images          # Images
|   |   └──  Stylesheets     # Stylesheets
│   ├── Components          # Reusable React components
│   │   ├── Component1      # Specific component folder
│   │   ├── Component2      # Another component folder
│   │   ├── index.js        # index file
│   │   └── ...             # Other component folders
│   │
│   ├── Constants           # Links, data, and other constants
│   ├── Pages               # Individual page components
│   │   ├── index.js        # index file
│   │   ├── Page1           # Specific page folder
│   │   ├── Page2           # Another page folder
│   │   └── ...             # Other page folders
│   │
│   ├── Themes              # Material-UI theme configuration
│   │   └──  index.js        # index file
│   │
│   ├── App.js              # Main component where routes and app structure are defined
│   ├── index.js            # Entry point of the React app
│   │
│   ├── components/index.js # Combined index file for all components
│   ├── constants/index.js  # Combined index file for all constants

```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the Poll App repository to your local machine and navigate to the `client` folder using Git:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd poll-app/client
```

Replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). In the `client` folder, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Start the development server to run the client-side application locally. In the `client` folder, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The client application will start and run at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access the application in your web browser.

### 4. Access the Poll App

Open your web browser and access the Poll App at `http://localhost:3000`. You can now create and participate in polls, visualize data, and explore the app's features.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the client-side of the Poll App project on your local machine. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance. Happy coding! 🚀
